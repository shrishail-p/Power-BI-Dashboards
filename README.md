Project Title: Blinkit Sales Report

Overview: The Blinkit Sales Report project involved a comprehensive data analysis process aimed at deriving actionable insights from sales data. The project utilized a multi-step approach involving data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to facilitate better decision-making.

Process:

Data Cleaning with Excel:

The initial phase focused on cleaning and preparing the sales data. Using Excel, I identified and rectified inconsistencies, removed duplicates, and ensured the dataset was ready for analysis. This step was crucial to enhance data quality and accuracy.
Data Analysis with MySQL:

After cleaning, the refined dataset was imported into MySQL for in-depth analysis. SQL queries were crafted to extract meaningful insights, such as sales trends, product performance, and regional sales comparisons. This phase involved creating various analytical metrics to support business objectives.
Data Visualization with Power BI:

The final step involved using Power BI to visualize the analyzed data. I leveraged DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions to create interactive dashboards that displayed key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends. These visualizations provided an intuitive way to communicate findings and support strategic decision-making.
Outcome: The Blinkit Sales Report project successfully transformed raw sales data into valuable insights, enabling stakeholders to understand performance metrics and make informed decisions. The integration of Excel, MySQL, and Power BI showcased a seamless workflow from data cleaning to visualization, highlighting the importance of each step in the data analysis process.
